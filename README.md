# ODA-project


## Project Description

[Enter a brief description of your project, including the data you used and the analytical methods you applied. Be sure to provide context for your project and explain why it is important.]

  Development aid has been growing for the past decades, and more recently, China appears to be a big donator, alongside the countries from the Development Assistance Committee (DAC).  Our project is a comparison between the Official Development Assistance (ODA) flows of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and the ODA of China, with a focus on the sectors these two groups donate to.  Through this project we aim to look at the influence of the GDP on the amounts of ODA flows that one sector gets.  As China announced that it wanted to take an alternative path the development, we came to ask ourselves Do economic recessions have a greater impact on the education sector when donors are DAC countries rather than China?  Through regression analysis, we will bring some tools to answer these kinds of questions.
  This project is based on the data retrieved from the OECD data bank and China's data is based on Version 3 of Aidata (2024), which previous studies such as Guillon et al. (2020) used, as China is not one of the DAC countries and of course its ODA isn't considered as ODA by these DAC countries. Because of the strict definition of ODA, previous studies either focus on DAC countries or emerging donors, such as China. China has been known for challenging the way how DAC advocates and allocates ODA, and has been reshaping it with its characteristics. (Bräutigam, 2011) In this sense, this project attempts to converge and compare the ODA in two approaches. Most importantly, this project found China mainly allocated its ODA to the economic sectors in the findings of Guillon et al, (2020) so that's one of the incentives to have this project. Moreover, given the official report about ODA from OECD (2023), ODAs are growing because of COVID-19 and the Ukraine-Russia war, but there are inconsistencies hence the project aims to analyze the dynamics of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to uncover patterns, trends, and priorities in international development funding.
  In short, this project is going to scrutinize the donors' data to analyze how donors allocate their ODA to different sectors, which is the most correlated with donors' GDP.

First, we decided to look for the top 5 sectors that receive the most allocations from the DAC countries, these are the prvlieged sectors: Education

Raphaela (DAC) and 


  
  For China, the top 5 sectors are (1) banking and financial services, (2)energy, (3)industry, mining, construction, (4) other multisector, and (5) transportation and storage. Figure 4. shows that the line of other multisector skyrocketed from around 2015 to 2018, and this project took a closer look and found the reason why it is defined as a "multisector" because it encompasses many sectors at the same time, such as education and transportation, infrastructure projects, and even economics, production, and social sectors at the same time, etc. Most importantly, this project found that for instance, the majority of recipients under the other multisector are invited to the Belt and Road Initiative, except for Mauritius, Gaza, etc, or cross multiple nations.

  In addition, this project ran the regression analysis to figure out which specific sector has the most significant impact on China's ODA, and it turned out to be the sector of transportation and storage. (p<0.001) This project further delves into the correlation coefficient relationship between the ODA in the sector and transportation and storage and GDP. Figure 6. depicts the significant correlation coefficient effect of the sector of transportation on China's GDP. (R=0.53**) Namely, the more amount on transportation and storage, the higher GDP China may accomplish.

  Generally, this project attempts to discover any predictors of China's ODA and runs the regression analysis with some indicators, such as GDP, Human Development Index, (HDI), and Debt. It turns out that HDI can predict China's ODA, but the effect is very limited. (Figure 7.) With these three indicators, this project also found that there is a negative relationship between Debt and the percentage taking up the amount of China's GDP. It can be interpreted that China is less willing to donate compared to its GDP when it has a higher debt. (Figure 8.)

## Results

[Provide a summary of your findings and conclusions, including any recommendations or implications for future research. Be sure to explain how your results address your research question or problem statement.]

Raphaela (DAC) 
  Consistent with Guillion et al., (2020) this project found that China profoundly allocates its ODA to economic sectors. One of the top five sectors, transportation and storage, has the most significant impact on its ODA. Moreover, the ODA for the transportation and storage sector is positively correlated and affected by China's GDP. It suggests that the higher the amount of the ODA of transportation, the higher the GDP, and vice versa. Besides the transportation sector, another spike, in other multisector from around 2015 to 2018, allowed many recipients to achieve cross-sector tasks at the same time. By specifically filtering with other multisector during that time and eliminating BRI members (Nedopil,2023), this project finds most recipients under multisector are BRI members, excluding Gaza, Mauritius, and Sao Tome and Principe.  
  However, one-half of China's lending to developing countries is not recorded in the main international databases used by researchers and practitioners alike. (Horn et al., 2021) Moreover, there are some vague definitions of flow types in data, which were eliminated by this project. Hence, there might be more latent possibilities differentiating significance. Indeed, as Guillion et al. (2020) stated, China puts its policy consideration and national interest first place, but it is controversial but critical to bear in mind that these emerging donors, such as China may incur latent influences on developing countries through their definition of ODA and challenges to DAC.
