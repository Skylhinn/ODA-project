## Project Description

[Enter a brief description of your project, including the data you used and the analytical methods you applied. Be sure to provide context for your project and explain why it is important.]

Development aids are growing for the past decades, more recently, China appears to be a big donators, alongside the countries from the Development Assistance Committee (DAC).  Our project is a comparison between the Official Development Assistance (ODA) flows of the Development Assistance Committe (DAC) and ODA of China, with a focus on the sectors these two groups donate to.  Through this projet we aim looking at the influence of the GDP to the amounts of ODA flows that one sectors gets.  As China announced that it wanted to take an alternative path the development, we came to ask ourselves Do economic recessions have a greater impact on the education sector when donors are DAC countries rather than China ?  Through regression analysis, we will bring some tools to anszwer these kind of questions.
This project is based on the dataset retrieved from the OECD data bank and <<please Roger write something for China>>, 



are growing, but there are inconsistencies hence the project aims to analyse the dynamics of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to uncover patterns, trends, and priorities in international development funding.
